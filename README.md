# Free Sleep — Local Control for 8 Sleep Pods

> This is a modified fork of Free Sleep. See **About this fork** below for the differences from upstream.

## About this fork

This fork is based on [Free Sleep](https://github.com/throwaway31265/free-sleep) and keeps the original Free Sleep functionality while adding changes focused on easier Pod 3 setup and reliable fully local operation.

### Wi-Fi provisioning

If the Pod cannot connect to a saved Wi-Fi network during boot, this fork automatically starts a temporary setup network:

- Wi-Fi: `FreeSleep-Setup`
- Setup page: `http://192.168.4.1`

Connect to `FreeSleep-Setup`, open `http://192.168.4.1`, select the home Wi-Fi network and enter its password.

Once the connection succeeds it is saved as `FreeSleep-WiFi` and will reconnect automatically on future boots.

If a saved Wi-Fi connection is already working, the provisioning service exits without starting the setup network.

The setup network is available for ten minutes. If the setup window expires, reboot or power-cycle the Pod to start a fresh setup window.

### Pod 3 WAN blocking fix

The upstream WAN blocking script silently drops blocked outbound traffic.

On the Pod 3 configuration tested with this fork, that could cause the stock `frankenfirmware` process to stall during boot while attempting external connections, resulting in:

- `Franken sock` failing
- `Franken monitor` not starting
- device controls being unavailable

This fork rejects blocked outbound WAN traffic immediately instead of silently dropping it.

The Pod remains blocked from WAN access, but failed connections return immediately rather than waiting for network timeouts. This allows the tested Pod 3 configuration to boot successfully with WAN access blocked.

### Installer changes

The installer in this fork:

- installs this fork rather than the upstream repository
- performs a clean `npm ci` server dependency installation
- installs and enables the Wi-Fi provisioning service
- keeps the updater pointed at this fork

## Overview
Free Sleep is an open-source project that lets you control your Eight Sleep Pod locally — without relying on the cloud or the official app.
Each Pod actually runs a small Linux computer inside it. Free Sleep installs a lightweight server on that computer, giving you full local control.
- **Server**: Runs directly on the Pod and talks to its hardware using custom APIs.
- **App**: A simple, user-friendly web interface for changing temperatures, schedules, alarms, and settings. See [app demo here](https://free-sleep.vercel.app/)

## Compatability
- Pod 1 - ❌ **NOT COMPATIBLE**
- Pod 2 - ❌ **NOT COMPATIBLE**
- Pod 3 - **(With SD card)** - ✅
- Pod 3 - **(No SD card)** - ✅ FCC ID: 2AYXT61100001 (The FCC ID is located in the back of the pod where you plug in the water tubes)
- Pod 4 ✅
- Pod 5 ✅

## FAQ
### Is it reversible?
Yes, you can easily firmware reset the pod and go back to the official 8 Sleep App

### Will I brick my pod?
Pod 3 **without** the SD card, Pod 4, and Pod 5 are impossible to brick - _as long as you follow the directions_ 

### Will it void my warranty?
Free Sleep is not officially supported by 8 Sleep, so there’s always a chance it could affect your warranty.
That said, you can fully reset the firmware and return the Pod to its original state at any time, and there’s no permanent modification made to the hardware.


## Features
- Allows complete control of device WITHOUT requiring internet access. If you lose internet, your pod WILL NOT turn off, it will continue working! You can completely block WAN internet access if you'd like too. (I blocked all internet access from my pod on my router...)
- WARNING: This will bypass blocked devices, please use responsibly
- Dynamic temperature control with real-time updates
- Schedule management: 
  - Set power on/off times 
  - Schedule temperature adjustments
  - Schedule daily time to prime the pod
  - Alarms - If you turn off the Pod prior to the alarm running, then the alarm will not run
- Settings customization: Configure timezones, away mode, brightness of LED on pod
- Website works on desktop and mobile


### Biometrics 📈
- **The only biometrics data that has been validated is heart rate**, HRV & breathing rates have not been validated & may be inaccurate.
Heart rates were validated over 33 sleep periods from 3 males & 3 females against mostly Apple Watches. 
**Heart rate calculations tend to be slightly less accurate for females**
- Summary statistics for all 33 periods:
  - RMSE - 2.88 average, 1.45 min, 7.63 max 
  - Correlation - 80.8% average, 27% min, 95% max
  - MAE - 1.83 average, 1 min, 5.77 max
- How to enable:
  - `sh /home/dac/free-sleep/scripts/enable_biometrics.sh`
- How to disable:
  - `sh /home/dac/free-sleep/scripts/disable_biometrics.sh`

#### Biometrics Overview

All biometric and sleep data is inserted into SQLite @ `/persistent/free-sleep-data/free-sleep.db`.

1. Vitals (Heart rate, breath rate, HRV) `biometrics/stream/stream.py` - This runs 24/7 and calculates vitals when it detects presence.
Vitals are inserted once every 60 seconds & you can access the raw data @ <POD_IP>/api/metrics/vitals
